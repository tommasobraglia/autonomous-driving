- ROS2 basics and node development
- Communication using topics, services, and actions
- Sensor integration and perception pipelines
- Path planning and control (eventually)
- Simulation environments (e.g., Gazebo, RViz)

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** C++, Python
- **Framework:** ROS2 Humble 
- **Build System:** colcon + CMake 
- **Sim Tools:** RViz2, Gazebo (planned)
